## Original Project

- **Project**: DevFlow - Multi-Agent Development Workflow Framework
- **Repository**: https://github.com/dondetir/DevFlow
- **Author**: @dondetir

## Inspiration and Starting Point

DevFlow provided the foundational architecture and concepts that inspired AutoSDLC:

- Multi-agent prompt engineering framework
- Gate-based workflow system
- Long-term memory architecture (semantic, episodic, procedural)
- Documentation mode optimization
- GitHub Copilot integration patterns
- Installation and deployment model

AutoSDLC builds upon these foundations with additional features and customizations while maintaining the core philosophy of structured AI-driven development.

## Gratitude

We are deeply grateful to the DevFlow project and its contributors for creating this innovative framework and making it available as open source. Their work has significantly accelerated our development process and inspired new approaches to AI-assisted software development.
